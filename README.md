#  Help Desk Support Toolkit (PowerShell)

## Project Overview

This project is a PowerShell-based toolkit designed to help IT support staff automate and streamline common troubleshooting tasks. It includes system diagnostics, network testing, login history retrieval, and temp file cleanup â€” all combined into a single master script.

This toolkit was created as part of the CourseCareers IT Support Program and is intended to demonstrate practical scripting skills for entry-level help desk roles.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed by me as part of the CourseCareers IT Support program.

Throughout the process, I used OpenAI's ChatGPT as a supplemental resource, similar to how one might use documentation or a study partner. I asked questions when I got stuck, validated my actions, and used the tool to double-check syntax or troubleshoot unexpected behavior.

All scripts, structure, and implementation decisions were written and executed by me.

##  Notes

- Must be run with local admin rights
- Tested on Windows 10 and 11
- You may need to allow script execution:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
